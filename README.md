Python bindings to the triangle library:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

The library depends on setuptools. On Debian Wheezy uninstall the
python-setuptools package that comes with the system, and explicitly
install the latest setuptools from:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/1.0
